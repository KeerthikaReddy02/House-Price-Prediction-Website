## Process of developing the Project
-	Build the ML Model using libraries like sklearn and store the model trained on the dataset as a pickle file to access it later.
-	Make a Flask API by importing the previously made pickle file to communicate with the website backend (NodeJS).
-	Design the website frontend using online tools like Figma and implement this in code using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS.
-	Build the backend with the Routes and integrate it with the Frontend and the Flask app.
-	Host the ML model (I used PythonAnywhere), host the NodeJS backend and ReactJS frontend (I used Render).

## Tech stack 
-	Frontend- ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
-	Backend- NodeJS, ExpressJS, Flask
-	ML Model- Sklearn
-	Visualization- Looker Studio
